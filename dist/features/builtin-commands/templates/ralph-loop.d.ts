export declare const RALPH_LOOP_TEMPLATE = "You are starting a Ralph Loop - a self-referential development loop that runs until task completion.\n\n## How Ralph Loop Works\n\n1. You will work on the task continuously\n2. When you believe the task is FULLY complete, output: `<promise>{{COMPLETION_PROMISE}}</promise>`\n3. If you don't output the promise, the loop will automatically inject another prompt to continue\n4. Maximum iterations: Configurable (default 100)\n\n## Rules\n\n- Focus on completing the task fully, not partially\n- Don't output the completion promise until the task is truly done\n- Each iteration should make meaningful progress toward the goal\n- If stuck, try different approaches\n- Use todos to track your progress\n\n## Exit Conditions\n\n1. **Completion**: Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` (or custom promise text) when fully complete\n2. **Max Iterations**: Loop stops automatically at limit\n3. **Cancel**: User runs `/cancel-ralph` command\n\n## Your Task\n\nParse the arguments below and begin working on the task. The format is:\n`\"task description\" [--completion-promise=TEXT] [--max-iterations=N]`\n\nDefault completion promise is \"DONE\" and default max iterations is 100.";
export declare const CANCEL_RALPH_TEMPLATE = "Cancel the currently active Ralph Loop.\n\nThis will:\n1. Stop the loop from continuing\n2. Clear the loop state file\n3. Allow the session to end normally\n\nCheck if a loop is active and cancel it. Inform the user of the result.";
